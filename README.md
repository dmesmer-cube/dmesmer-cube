My name is Davis Mesmer and I am a Computer Information Systems Major at James Madison University.

Currently, I am working on a Capstone Project in Cybersecurity focusing around simulating a DDOS attack on remote servers.
To research this project, I conducted a DOS attack on my home network by using Aireplay-ng and denying user access by decrypting WPA2 key connections.

I post coding and development projects on GitHub, along with other projects that I am working on. 
You can find some of my Python programs here, and other projects from languages/command lines I am learning.

I am looking for internships in Cloud Server Administration/Computing, Linux/Bash, and other DevOps related opportunities.

Thanks,
-Davis M. ðŸ™‚
