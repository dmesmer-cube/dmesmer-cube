My name is Davis Mesmer and I am a Computer Information Systems Major at James Madison University.

Currently, I am working on a Capstone Project focusing on app development and requirements gathering.

I post development projects on GitHub, along with other projects that I am working on. 
You can find some of my Python and PowerShell programs here, and other projects from languages/command lines I am learning.

Thanks,
-Davis M. ðŸ™‚
